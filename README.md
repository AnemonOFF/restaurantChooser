## Running the App

### On iOS

Open a new terminal and run:

```bash
  npx react-native run-ios
```

This will build the app and launch it in the iOS Simulator.

### On Android

1. Start an Android emulator from Android Studio or connect a physical Android device.
2. Open a new terminal and run:

```bash
   npx react-native run-android
```

This will build the app and launch it on the Android emulator or connected device.

## Troubleshooting

- If the app doesn't launch in the simulator, ensure Xcode is installed and properly configured.

### Android

- Ensure the Android emulator is running or a physical device is connected.
- If you encounter issues with the Android build, ensure the Android SDK is installed and properly configured in Android Studio.
- Check that the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable is set correctly.

## Additional Notes

- To run the app on a physical device, ensure your device is connected and trusted, and follow the instructions in the [React Native documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/running-on-device).
- For any issues, check the React Native [troubleshooting guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/troubleshooting).
